# InkscapeQRVCard
Modification to Inkscape plugin by Sergey Vedernikov

## Reason 
This plugin has been originally written by Sergey Vedernikov. It is heavily based on other people's work and was initially building the VCARD QR Code encoding the birthday, I wanted to have a web site instead to use the generated QR code on business cards, so I made just a series very small changes to both the pytohn file and to the ".inx" file that defines the user interface. 

## Install
The two files need to be copied in the extensions directory of Inkscape, then they will add a menu item "QR Code Vcard" in the Extensions/Rendering/Barcode menu.
